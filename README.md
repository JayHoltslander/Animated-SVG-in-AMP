# Animated SVG in AMP

You can use animated SVGs within an [AMP html](https://www.ampproject.org/) page. 

For the demo here the AMP logo was animated with [Keyshape](https://www.keyshapeapp.com) and then exported. The export animation option was set to **CSS** rather than **KeyshapeJS**. The resulting exported SVG file had its embedded CSS animation extracted and then inserted instead into the page's ``<style amp-custom>``
